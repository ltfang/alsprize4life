To run the driver file, main.R, a user must define the variables train.name and test.name and place txt files with the corresponding names in the same directory. For example, if these variables are set to be train.name = "traintest" and test.name = "val" (as they are by default), then the code will try to load training data from a file traintest.txt in the same directory and try to load test data from a file val.txt in that directory.  

Users will be unable to run the code until they supply the corresponding training and test files. Please register at “https://nctu.partners.org/ProACT” to obtain the necessary data.
